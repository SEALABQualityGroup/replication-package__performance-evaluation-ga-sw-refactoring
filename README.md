Replication package for the paper:

**Performance of Genetic Algorithms in the Context of Software Model Refactoring**

The replication package requires `python3`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`.

To set this up in a virtualenv:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate the plots from the paper (in the `figs` folder):
```
python plot.py
```
